### Hello, I'm Khari
üëã Hi there! I'm a 25-year-old developer based in London, with a burning passion for all things AI. Currently, I'm on a journey to expand my skillset and explore exciting opportunities that combine my background in Aerospace engineering with my ongoing studies in Artificial Intelligence.

### Background
üöÄ I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Aerospace, achieving Second Class Honours (Upper Division) from the University of Leicester. Additionally, I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Hull, where I'm predicted to attain a Merit. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in engineering principles and a deep understanding of AI technologies.

### What I'm Up To
üîç Currently, I'm actively seeking roles that leverage both my engineering background and AI expertise. My goal is to contribute to cutting-edge projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in technology.

### Interests
üèÄ When I'm not immersed in code or data, you can find me on the basketball court, honing my skills and enjoying the thrill of the game. I'm also a big fan of anime, finding inspiration in its imaginative storytelling and vibrant visuals.
